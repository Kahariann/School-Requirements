## What's New
### Activity 1 (2/2)
1) *Which dissolves faster, the detergent bar or detergent powder?*
> Detergent Powder ✅
2) *What could be the possible reason on the difference of the dissolving rate between the detergent bar and powder? Why is this so?*
> Particle size, because smaller particles of the detergent will dissolve faster than the larger particle size. ✅
### Activity 2 (2/2)
1) *What is the difference between the two nails after two days?*
> The iron nail in Cup 2 is more rusted than the iron in Cup 1. ✅
2) *How will you explain these differences?*
> The higher the amount of vinegar, the more rust is produced on the iron nail. ✅
### Activity 3 (3/3)
a1) *Is there any noticeable difference between hot water and cold water?*
> Yes ✅

a2) *Which has a faster reaction, hot or cold water?*
> Hot ✅

a3) *What is the effect of temperature on reaction rate?*
> The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction. ✅

b1) *Cite at least 2 temperature related food preservation method that you always do at home.*
> Refrigeration and Freezing. 

b2) *Give a brief description on each method.*
> **Refrigeration** is the method of preserving the food in a low temperature container.
> While **freezing** is the method of freezing the, of course, food. 

b3) *What do you think is the effect of temperature with food preservation?*
> Preserving the food in a low temperature will cause the chemical change to slow down. 

### Activity 4 (1/1)
1) *Why do some fruits and vegetables turn brown when exposed to air?*
> Because of enzymatic browning. ✅
2) *Cite at least 3 other examples of fruits and vegetables that undergoes browning when exposed to air.*
> Potatoes and Apples.
3) *Suggest other ways that slows or prevents the browning of some sliced fruits and vegetables.*
> Submerging the fruits under plain water or keep them in an air-tight container to avoid exposing them to air.

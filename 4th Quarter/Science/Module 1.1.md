### Activity 3 (3/3)
1) The air inside the balloon is a gas, so the particles are moving very fast in  
random directions and separated by lots of space. They collide frequently with  
the inside wall of the balloon, which is what keeps the balloon fully inflated.  
When the balloon is placed in the refrigerator and cooled, the particles of air  
slow down. They don’t collide frequently or as hard with the balloon wall. The  
balloon wall squeezes the air particles closer together as the balloon shrinks  
in size.  ✅
2) Originally, because the mothballs are solid, the particles are close together and  
vibrating in fixed positions. The fact that the bag becomes inflated and the  
mothballs become smaller indicates that part of the mothballs must have  
become a gas. As a gas, the mothball particles move freely and are separated  
by a great deal more space, which is why the bag became inflated. ✅
3) Particles of the gas inside the aerosol can are compressed or squeezed very  
close together. Heat energy from the stove causes these particles to move faster  
and to exert greater pressure on the inside surface of the can, enough to cause  
the can to explode. ✅

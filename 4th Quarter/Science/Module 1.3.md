### Activity 3 (3/3)
1) *An inflated balloon is placed in the refrigerator. When it is removed an hour  
later, it has shrunk to about half of its original size.*
> The air inside the move erraticaly in random directions and separated by lots of space. They collide a lot within the walls, which is why the balloon is inflated. When the balloon is placed inside a refrigrerator and gets cold, the particles of air slow down. Which means that they don't collide that much anymore and the walls now shrinks, squeezing the air particles closer. ✅
2) *A woman places several moth balls in a ziplock bag and seals the bag. Several days later, she notices that the bag has become inflated and the moth balls are much smaller.*
> The particles of the mothballs are vibrating in very close proximity. Because of the bag becoming inflated, the mothballs are becoming smaller because of its parts becoming gas. These parts that became gas are now moving freely and fill up the empty space. ✅
3) *An aerosol can is inadvertently placed on a kitchen counter very near the  
stove. A stove burner is turned and several minutes later the aerosol container  
explode.*
> The particles of the gas inside the container are compressed very close together. The heat causes them to move faster and erratically, causing an explosion. ✅

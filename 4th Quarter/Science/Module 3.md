## What's New (2/2)
a) *What happened when vinegar was added to baking soda?*
> When baking soda was added to the vinegar, bubbles started to form. ✅

b) *What signs have you observed which signify a chemical reaction?*
> A chemical reaction takes place because there is an evolution of gas. ✅

___
## What's More
### Activity 1 (3/3)
a) *We call the substances before the chemical reaction as reactants. What are the reactants in the bubbles out experiment?*
> Baking soda and Vinegar ✅

b) *What do you think happened to the reactants during the chemical reactions?*
> They've undergone chemical change. ✅

c) *We call the substances produced during the chemical reaction, the products. What are the products of the bubbles out experiment?*
> Sodium Acetate and Carbonic Acid ✅

### Activity 3 (5/5)
#### A
1a) *What are the reactants in the equation above?*
> Chlorine (Cl2) and Sodium bromide (NaBr) ✅

1b) *What are the products?*
> Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Bromine (Br2) ✅

1c) *Check the equation if it confirms with the Law of Conservation of Mass.*
Reactant Side|Element|Product Side
-----|-----|-----
2 x 1 = 2 ✅|Cl ✅|2 x 1 = 2 ✅
2 x 1 = 2 ✅|Na ✅|2 x 1 = 2 ✅
2 x 1 = 2 ✅|Br ✅|2 ✅

1d) *Is the reaction balanced? Explain.*
> Yes, because they have the same number of atoms on both reactants and products side. ✅

1e) *What is conservation of mass? How does it relate to this exercise?*
> Conservation of mass says that the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products.
> As long as the carbon dioxide was not allowed to escape, the change in mass that occurred during the reaction should be zero. ✅

## What's More (4/4)
### Activity 1
#### 2)
Temperature (K) | Volume | v/t = k (mL/K)
----- | ----- | -----
50 | 22.5 | 0.45
100 | 45.0 | 0.45
150 | 67.5 | 0.45
200 | 90.0 | 0.45
300 | 135.0 | 0.45
500 | 225.0 | 0.45
800 | 360 | 0.45
1000 | 450 | 0.45
#### 3) ✅
*Refer to Column 3, what can you conclude as to the values of “k”*
> The values of k are all the same.

#### 4) ✅
*Plot the temperature (K) on the x-axis against the volume (mL) on the y-axis.*

#### 5)  ✅
*What does the graph show about the relation between volume and  
temperature of a gas at constant pressure?*
> The increase of volume is directly proportional to the increase of temeperature.

#### 6) ✅
*What is the temperature when the volume is equal to zero? Hypothetically  
speaking, what does this indicate?*
> It means that there is no more gas, theoretically.

### Assessment 1 (5/5)
1) Increase ✅
2) 530mL ✅
3) 700 K ✅
4) 0 K ✅
5) 0.50 mL/K ✅

### Activity 2 (6/6)
#### 2)
a)  V1 = V2T1/T2 ✅
b) V2 = V1T2/T1 ✅
c) T1 = V1T2/V2 ✅
d) T2 = V2T1/V1 ✅

#### 3)
##### a) ✅
**Given:** V1 = 2.20 L
T1 = 25.0 + 273.15 = 298.15 K
T2 = 51.0 + 273.15 = 324.15 K
**Required:** V2
**Solution:** V2 = V1T2/T1 = 2.20 (324.15K) / 298.15 K
**Answer:** V2 = 2.39 L
##### b) ✅
**Given:** V1 = 3480 mL
V2 = 2450 mL
T1 = -67 + 273.15 = 203.15 K
**Required:** T2 (K)
**Solution:** T2 = V2T1/V1 = 2450 mL (203.15 K) / 3480 mL
**Answer:** T2 = 143 K

### Assessment 2 (5/5)

3) C ✅
4) 8 L ✅
5) -34 ⁰C ✅

### Activity 3 (3/3)
1) *We all have seen hot air balloons flying. But has anyone wondered how it works? An air balloon consists of a bag, a basket to carry passengers, and a source of heat. The heat source is usually a fuel like propane which on burning causes the heating of the air surrounding it. How is Charles’ Law applied in hot air balloons?* ✅
	> According to Charle's Law, the volume of the balloon will increase when it's filled with hot air. And because the balloon is high up in the air, it occupies more volume with the same density as the air surrounding it. 
2) *If you get a chance to read the instructions on a bottle of deodorant, you might have read the warning signs indicating the bottle to be kept away from the sunlight and high temperature. How is Charles’ Law applied in this situation?* ✅
>	The air molecules inside the deodorant will increase and will explode if the temperature is hot.
3) *Yeast is used in preparation of many bakery products. This yeast keeps  
liberating carbon dioxide gas. How is Charles’ Law applied in baking? ✅*
>	The yeast keeps releasing carbon dioxide gas, which bubbles under high temperature. The carbon dioxide bubbles expanding works as a leavening agent and cause the bakery to become fluffy.

### Assessment 3 (5/5)
1) *Jogging is very difficult in during the month of December compare to the  
month of April. The reason is simply due to low temperatures our lungs shrink  
which decrease the human lungs' capacity.* ✅
>	Yes
2) *A pressure cooker reducing the cooking time of food.* ✅
> 	No
3) *When ascending or descending in a plane, or taking a subway or train under a deep waterway, your ears "pop", or feel uncomfortable.* ✅
>	No
4) *When bloated pool floats are pushed into pools, they appear as under-inflated.* ✅
>	Yes
5) *Turkey thermometer is placed in the turkey. As the temperature increases and the turkey cooks, the air in the thermometer expands to pop the plunger.* ✅
>	Yes

___
## What I Can Do (3/3)
1) Let it float on warm water for a while, so the temperature of the air inside the ball will increase. Because of this, the volume of the gas will expand, resulting in the ball's shape to be restored. ✅
2) It can be applied with the help of yeast. It produces a carbon dioxide gas and when baked in a high temperature, they expand. In which it makes the bread or cake look very fluffy and delicious. ✅
3) The definition of Charles' Law states that under high temperatures, the gas molecules inside the deodorant bottle expands. Which will result into an explosion of the bottle. ✅
